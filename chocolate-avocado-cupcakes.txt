Avocado Cupcakes 

3 c (360g) flour
6 Tbls (32g) unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 tsp salt
2 tsp baking powder
2 tsp baking soda
2 c (400g) granulated sugar
1/4 c (60ml) vegetable oil
1/2 c (120 ml) soft avocado, well mashed, about 1 medium avocado
2 Tbls white vinegar
2 tsp vanilla extract
2 c (470ml) water

Preheat oven to 350F (175C). Oil and line two 8 or 9-inch pans (I used two 6-inch cakes and made 6 cupcakes with the extra batter). Set aside.

In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa, salt, baking powder and baking soda set aside.

Whisk together the sugar, oil, mashed avocado, vinegar and vanilla, then add the water. Sift in the dry ingredients all at once, then whisk until smooth.

Pour batter into prepared tins and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.

Let cakes cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a rack to cool completely.

Avocado Buttercream Frosting 
Like I said, you can't taste the avocado in this. It has a light citrus flavor (maybe... Orange?), but it's not lemony - the juice keeps it from browning, so be sure that you don't leave it out! It tastes like any other American-style buttercream, so be aware that it is quite sweet!

8 oz (225g) fresh avocado, about 2 small to medium, very ripe avocados
2 tsp lemon juice
1 lb (455g) powdered sugar, sifted (use more for a thicker frosting)
1/2 tsp vanilla 

Peel and pit the avocados. Place the avocado meat into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment along with the lemon juice and beat until lightened in color and very well mashed, approximately 2 to 3 minutes. Be sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl from time to time. Sift in the powdered sugar a little at a time and beat until smooth. Add the vanilla and mix to combine. If not using right away, store in the refrigerator.
